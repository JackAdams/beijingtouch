    <h1>Beijing Touch</h1>
    <p>Touch has been played in Beijing for a long time. There were years when there were 12 or 14 teams competing in a weekly league and Beijing sides won tournaments all around Asia. And there were years when we struggled to get numbers for a Saturday morning pick-up game.</p>
    <p>At present, there are weekly pick-up games on Saturday mornings, with occasional mid-week games and occasional mini-tournaments. A recent highlight was the first Beijing International Touch Rugby Tournament, which was awesome. And we're looking to develop the sport to include more local youth.</p>
    <h1>The game</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.sportingpulse.com/get_file.cgi?id=2906392" target="_blank">The rules of touch</a> are determined by the <a href="http://www.international-touch.org/" target="_blank">Federation of Internation Touch</a>.</p>
    <p>To see how it is played, watch these videos:

    <p>You don't need to sign up or call ahead. Just roll up to Chaoyang Park on a Saturday morning (usually 11am). We play on Pitch 12 (Gate 7) and split the cost of the pitch. It's usually 30-40 RMB per player.</p>

    <h1>Development of Touch in Beijing</h1>
    <p>Development of touch in Beijing has been sporadic, with the members of the transient expat population bringing their experience in playing, coaching and refereeing, then taking it away again when they leave.</p>
    <p>More recently, local players have been developing their coaching and refereeing skills through FIT approved training courses, and we are starting to see a growing number of local players involved in the game. It is particularly pleasing to see the development that is happening with the youth in Beijing.</p>
